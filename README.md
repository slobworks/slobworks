- 👋 Hi, I’m @slobworks
- 👀 Unless otherwise specified, everything listed in my repositories is considered PUBLIC DOMAIN.
- 🌱 If you absolutely must use one of those 'open source' licenses with something you'll use from my repositories, I won't stop you.
-    I recommend <a href=http://www.wtfpl.net/>WTFPL</a> or <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit">MIT/X</a>.
- 💞️ Some basic, simple ground rules (as if I could enforce any of them):
- 📫 - *Don't* contact me through my email please. I treat all unsolicited email communication as spam.
- 😄 - Constructive criticism is always appreciated, but mindless attempts at being edgy will be thoroughly ridiculed in private.
- ⚡ - Find something fun to make from my stuff!
